The Management Company is a **service company** — it has NO real estate assets, NO depreciation, NO debt (it is SAFE-funded). Its financial statements are fundamentally simpler.

**Key Differences from Property SPV:**
- No depreciation (no real estate assets)
- No interest expense (no debt — funded by SAFE agreements)
- No principal payments
- No NOI concept (NOI is a real estate metric)
- SAFE funding is NOT revenue — it is equity capital (classified as financing activity)
- Expenses begin only AFTER company operations start (Funding Gate rule)
- Revenue begins only when properties are operational and generating fees

**Fee Linkage Rule:** The Management Company's revenue MUST exactly match the sum of Management Fee expenses across all properties. This is a mandatory cross-entity validation.

**Expense Categories:**
- **Fixed costs** (escalate at `fixedCostEscalationRate`): Partner comp, staff comp, office lease, professional services, tech infra, business insurance
- **Variable costs** (escalate at `inflationRate`): Travel (per active property), IT licensing (per active property)
- **Revenue-linked**: Marketing (% of mgmt fee revenue), Misc Ops (% of mgmt fee revenue)

**Staffing Tiers:** Staff FTE is determined by active property count:
- Tier 1: ≤ N properties → X FTE
- Tier 2: ≤ M properties → Y FTE
- Tier 3: > M properties → Z FTE

**SAFE Funding Treatment:**
- SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) tranches are capital contributions, NOT revenue
- They appear on the Cash Flow Statement as financing activities
- They increase the company's cash position but do not affect Net Income
- The Funding Gate rule prevents expenses from being incurred before SAFE capital is received

## Common-Size Analysis (Percentage Rows)

### Income Statement
- **OpEx % of Revenue** row after operating expenses — shows `totalExpenses / totalRevenue × 100`
- Styled as italic gray inline row (not using shared MarginRow due to different table structure)

### Cash Flow Statement
- **% of Revenue** row after Net Cash from Operating Activities — shows `cashFromOps / totalRevenue × 100`
- Same inline styling pattern

### Assumption Label Clarity
Labels in CompanyAssumptions.tsx now specify the exact revenue base:
- **Marketing** → `(% of Mgmt Fee Revenue)` — percentage of total management fee revenue (base + incentive)
- **Misc Operations** → `(% of Mgmt Fee Revenue)` — same base as marketing
- **Base Management Fee** → `(% of Property Gross Revenue)` — per-property rate, defined on each property's edit page (default 5%, `DEFAULT_BASE_MANAGEMENT_FEE_RATE`)
- **Incentive Fee** → `(% of Property GOP)` — per-property rate, defined on each property's edit page (default 15%, `DEFAULT_INCENTIVE_MANAGEMENT_FEE_RATE`)
