# Claude Skills Examples

This document provides detailed, real-world examples of using the Claude Skills in this repository.

## Example 1: Complete Web App Design (Orchestrated)

### Scenario
You're launching a new meditation and mindfulness app called "Zenith" targeting busy professionals.

### Using the Orchestrator

**Your Request:**
```
I'm building a meditation app called Zenith for busy professionals 
who struggle with stress. I want something that feels calming but 
professional, not stereotypically "zen" with clichéd imagery.

Coordinate your specialists to deliver:
1. Research on meditation app design trends
2. A unique brand identity that stands out
3. Complete design system with CSS
4. Team composition to build it
```

**Orchestrator's Response:**

The Orchestrator will automatically delegate to specialists in this sequence:

#### Phase 1: Research (Research Analyst)
**Output**: Research Report
- Analysis of top 15 meditation apps
- Trend: Moving away from purple/lotus clichés toward minimal, modern aesthetics
- Insight: Professional users prefer "calm focus" over "spiritual enlightenment"
- Recommendation: Muted blues/greens, sans-serif typography, spacious layouts
- Competitive gap: No apps effectively bridge "productivity tool" and "wellness app"

#### Phase 2: Brand Identity (Web Design Expert)
**Output**: Brand Identity Guide
- **Brand Personality**: Focused Calm - professional yet soothing
- **Colors**: 
  - Primary: Deep Ocean Blue (#1a365d)
  - Secondary: Soft Sage (#9faa8e)
  - Accent: Warm Sand (#f5e6d3)
- **Typography**: 
  - Headers: Inter (geometric, modern)
  - Body: Source Serif Pro (readable, slightly warm)
- **Visual Language**: Breathing space, gentle curves, subtle depth
- **Key Principle**: "Clarity creates calm"

#### Phase 3: Design System (Design System Creator)
**Output**: Design Bible + CSS

**Design Tokens (CSS Custom Properties):**
```css

## Example 3: Research-Driven Decision Making

### Scenario
You're choosing between design approaches and need evidence-based insights.

**Your Request to Research Analyst:**
```
I'm building a SaaS dashboard. Should I go with a dark theme, 
light theme, or offer both? Research what top SaaS products do 
and why.
```

**Output:**

### SaaS Dashboard Theme Research Report

**Executive Summary:**
68% of top SaaS products now offer theme switching (dark + light). However, default matters: 82% default to light mode. Dark mode is preferred by developers and power users but can reduce accessibility for others. Recommendation: Light default with dark mode option.

**Key Findings:**

**1. Theme Preferences by User Type:**
- **Developers/Technical**: 73% prefer dark mode
- **Business Users**: 61% prefer light mode
- **Creative Professionals**: 55% prefer light mode
- **Data Analysts**: Split 50/50

**2. What Top Products Do:**
- **Notion**: Light default, dark option, sync with system
- **Linear**: Dark default (developer tool), light option
- **Figma**: Light default, dark option
- **Stripe Dashboard**: Light default, dark option
- **GitHub**: System preference default, both options

**3. Research on Impact:**
- **Accessibility**: Light mode has 30% better contrast options
- **Eye Strain**: No significant difference with proper implementation
- **Perceived Value**: Light = professional, Dark = technical/modern
- **Power Usage**: Dark saves 15-20% on OLED screens

**4. Implementation Best Practices:**
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Respect system preference as default
- Remember user choice in localStorage
- Ensure both themes meet WCAG contrast requirements
- Test all components in both themes

**Recommendation:**
Implement both with light as default, system preference detection, and persistent user choice. This serves the widest audience while respecting user preferences.

**Code Example:**
```css
/* Light theme (default) */
:root {
  --bg-primary: #ffffff;
  --text-primary: #1f2937;
  --border-color: #e5e7eb;
}

/* Dark theme */
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --bg-primary: #1f2937;
  --text-primary: #f9fafb;
  --border-color: #374151;
}
```

```javascript
// Detect and apply preference
const theme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 
              (window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches ? 'dark' : 'light');
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', theme);
```

## Example 5: Iterative Design Refinement

### Scenario
You want to refine a design through multiple iterations.

**Iteration 1 - Initial Concept:**
```
[To Web Design Expert]
Create initial brand identity for a plant care app called "Thrive"
```

**Iteration 2 - Feedback:**
```
The green is too expected for a plant app. Can we do something 
more unexpected while still feeling natural and growth-oriented?
```

**Iteration 3 - Refinement:**
```
I love the terracotta direction! Now create three variations of 
the color palette: warm, cool, and balanced.
```

**Iteration 4 - Finalization:**
```
The balanced palette is perfect. Now expand it into a complete 
design system with all the semantic color tokens we'll need.
```

This shows how to progressively refine using the skills rather than trying to get everything perfect in one shot.
