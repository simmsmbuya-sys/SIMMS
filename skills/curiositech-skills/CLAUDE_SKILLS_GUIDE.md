# Understanding Claude Skills: A Comprehensive Guide

## What Are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills are a revolutionary framework introduced by Anthropic in October 2025 that enables customized expertise for Claude AI agents through modular, reusable instruction sets. Think of them as "super prompts" that give Claude specialized capabilities in specific domains.

### The Core Concept

A Skill is essentially a structured folder containing:
- **SKILL.md file**: The main instruction file with YAML frontmatter
- **Additional resources**: Scripts, templates, examples, or reference materials
- **Executable code**: Optional Python scripts that run in sandboxed environments

## How Claude Skills Work

### Progressive Disclosure Architecture

Claude uses a smart loading system:

1. **Startup**: Only loads skill names and descriptions (minimal metadata)
2. **Task Matching**: Scans skills to find relevant ones for your task
3. **Full Loading**: Loads complete instructions only when needed
4. **Deep Access**: Fetches additional files if more context is required

This approach minimizes token usage while maintaining access to deep expertise.

### Example Skill Structure

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md                 # Main instructions with YAML frontmatter
├── templates/
│   └── example.html
├── scripts/
│   └── helper.py
└── examples/
    └── sample-output.md
```

**SKILL.md Format:**
```markdown
---
name: Web Design Expert
description: Creates unique web designs with brand identity
---

## Best Practices from the Community

### 🎯 Prompting Techniques

1. **Break Tasks Into Small Steps**
   - Don't ask for everything at once
   - Request incremental changes: "write function" → "add error handling" → "write tests"
   - Easier to course-correct as you go

2. **Use Role Assignment**
   - Tell Claude to "act as a senior developer" or "security expert"
   - Provides contextual focus for better results

3. **Be Explicit and Specific**
   - "Rewrite this for readability" beats "make this better"
   - Define clear success criteria

4. **Include Visual Examples**
   - Screenshots help with UI/design tasks
   - Diagrams clarify complex structures
   - Sample data formats prevent misunderstandings

5. **Leverage Project Memory**
   - Store conventions and common instructions
   - Avoid repetition across conversations
   - Maintains consistency
