# Testing & Proof System — Master Skill

## Purpose
Documents the full 2371-test automated verification system (112 files). Every financial statement, analysis, and engine calculation has dedicated tests that prove correctness without manual Excel verification.

## Commands
```bash
npm test                              # Run all 2371 tests
npm run verify                        # Full 7-phase verification (UNQUALIFIED = pass)
npx vitest run tests/statements/      # Statement tests only
npx vitest run tests/analytics/       # Analytics/returns tests only
npx vitest run tests/engine/          # Engine (property + company pro forma) tests only
npx vitest run tests/financing/       # Acquisition financing tests only
npx vitest run tests/refinance/       # Refinancing tests only
npx vitest run tests/funding/         # Funding instrument tests only
npx vitest run tests/proof/           # Proof system (scenarios + hardcoded detection)
npx vitest run tests/golden/          # Golden hand-calculated scenarios (65 tests, ~3s)
npx vitest run tests/calc/validation/ # Validation tests only
npx vitest run tests/auth/            # Auth utility tests only
```

## Test Suite Map (112 files, 2371 tests)

### By Domain

| **Golden Scenarios** | **`testing/golden-scenarios.md`** | **65 hand-calculated reference tests across 7 files: IRR, DCF, DSCR, depreciation, break-even, stress, waterfall, exit, equity, pro-forma edge cases** |

## Key Invariants (All Tested)

| Identity | GAAP Reference | Test Location |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| A = L + E | ASC 210 | `statements/balance-sheet`, `statements/cashflow-identities`, `proof/scenarios` |
| OCF = NI + Depreciation | ASC 230-10-45 | `proof/scenarios` |
| NI = NOI - Interest - Depreciation - Tax | ASC 220 | `proof/scenarios` |
| CFF = -Principal + Refi Proceeds | ASC 230-10-45-15 | `statements/cashflow-identities` |
| Ending Cash = Beginning + Net Change | ASC 230-10-45-24 | `statements/cashflow-identities`, `proof/scenarios` |
| FCFE (Direct) = FCFE (From NI) | Valuation identity | `analytics/fcfe-reconciliation` |
| NPV = 0 at IRR | Finance identity | `analytics/npv-irr-crosscheck` |
| Σ(SPV fees) = OpCo revenue | Intercompany | `proof/scenarios` (5), `engine/company-proforma` |
| Consolidated eliminations = 0 | ASC 810 | `proof/scenarios` (5) |

## 5 Golden Scenarios (tests/proof/scenarios.test.ts)

| # | Name | Tests | Entity Level |
|---|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Cash Purchase (Full Equity) | ~12 | Property |
| 2 | Financed Purchase (LTV) | ~12 | Property |
| 3 | Cash → Refinance Year 3 | ~12 | Property |
| 4 | Portfolio Aggregate | ~8 | Consolidated |
| 5 | Consolidated + Eliminations | ~8 | Consolidated + Mgmt Co |

## Maintenance Rules

1. **All 2371 tests must pass before any merge** — run `npm test`
2. **New financial calculations require new tests** — add to the appropriate domain directory
3. **New calculators require golden tests** — add hand-calculated reference values in `tests/golden/`
4. **New constants go in `shared/constants.ts`** — never inline magic numbers
5. **Hardcoded detection scans 8 finance files** — `proof/hardcoded-detection.test.ts`
6. **Update this skill and sub-skills when adding test suites**
7. **Only UNQUALIFIED audit opinion is acceptable** — run `npm run verify`
