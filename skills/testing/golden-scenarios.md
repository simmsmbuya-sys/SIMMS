# Testing: Golden Scenarios — Hand-Calculated Reference Values

## Scope
65 tests across 7 files in `tests/golden/` that pin every financial calculator to hand-calculated reference values. Each test includes the expected value derived from first principles (not computed by the engine), so any regression is caught immediately.

## Entity Level
**All Levels** — standalone calculators (IRR, NPV, DSCR, depreciation, break-even, stress test, waterfall, exit valuation, equity multiple) and full pro-forma engine edge cases.

## Run Commands
```bash
npx vitest run tests/golden/                          # All 65 golden tests (~3s)
npx vitest run tests/golden/irr-edge-cases.test.ts    # IRR edge cases (8 tests)
npx vitest run tests/golden/dcf-npv.test.ts           # DCF/NPV (8 tests)
npx vitest run tests/golden/equity-exit.test.ts       # Equity Multiple + Exit Valuation (9 tests)
npx vitest run tests/golden/dscr-loan-sizing.test.ts  # DSCR loan sizing (7 tests)
npx vitest run tests/golden/depreciation-breakeven.test.ts  # Depreciation + Break-Even (10 tests)
npx vitest run tests/golden/stress-waterfall.test.ts  # Stress Test + Waterfall (8 tests)
npx vitest run tests/golden/proforma-edge-cases.test.ts     # Pro-Forma engine edge cases (15 tests)

## Design Principles

1. **Hand-calculated values only** — every expected value in these tests was computed manually (not by the engine). Comments show the derivation.
2. **Penny-exact precision** — financial values use `toBeCloseTo(value, 2)` (nearest cent). Rates use `toBeCloseTo(value, 4)` or higher.
3. **NPV cross-check everywhere** — IRR tests always verify NPV(flows, IRR) ≈ 0 as an independent check.
4. **Edge cases first** — zero inputs, negative inputs, boundary conditions, and impossible scenarios are prioritized because those are where bugs hide.
5. **No engine dependency** — calculator tests import only the calculator being tested, not the full engine. Pro-forma tests use the engine but verify structural properties, not specific dollar amounts (which depend on constants).

## Relationship to Other Test Suites

| Suite | Purpose | Complementary To |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| `tests/proof/` | GAAP identity enforcement | Golden scenarios prove the *formulas* are right |
| `tests/analytics/` | IRR/NPV/MOIC solver correctness | Golden adds edge cases and hand-calcs |
| `tests/financing/` | Acquisition loan golden | Golden adds DSCR sizing edge cases |
| `tests/refinance/` | Refi golden | Golden adds pro-forma refi integration |
| `tests/engine/` | Pro-forma regression | Golden adds extreme edge cases |

## Maintenance Rules

1. **Never change expected values without re-deriving by hand** — if a test breaks, fix the engine, not the test
2. **Add new golden tests for every new calculator** — the calculator must have at least one hand-calculated reference
3. **Run `npx vitest run tests/golden/` after any financial engine change** — fast (3s), catches regressions immediately
4. **Keep derivation comments** — the `/*  ... */` block above each test IS the documentation
