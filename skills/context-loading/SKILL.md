description: Token-efficient context loading protocol. Maps common task types to the minimum required skills. Load this first to determine which other skills are needed.

# Context Loading Protocol

## Purpose
With 119 skill files, loading everything wastes tokens and slows responses. This skill maps common task types to the **minimum required** skill set, ensuring fast, focused sessions.

## Golden Rule
**Load `claude.md` first (always loaded automatically). Then load only the skills needed for the current task. Never load all skills at once.**

## Task-to-Skill Map

### Tier 1: Always Loaded (automatic)
- `claude.md` — Master doc, skill router, user preferences, project state

### Tier 2: Load by Task Type

## Loading Tiers by Request Complexity

### Quick Fix (1-2 skills)
User asks to fix a specific bug, tweak a label, adjust a color.
→ Load only the directly relevant skill. Skip everything else.

### Feature Work (2-4 skills)
User asks to add or modify a feature.
→ Load the domain skill + component library + any cross-cutting rules.

### Cross-Domain Work (4-6 skills)
User asks for something that spans finance + UI + testing.
→ Load the minimum from each domain. Use the table above.

### Full Audit (6+ skills)
User asks for verification, release prep, or comprehensive review.
→ Load proof-system, testing master, relevant finance skills, and audit rules.

## Anti-Patterns (Token Waste)

| Don't Do This | Do This Instead |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Load all 16 finance skills for an IS fix | Load `finance/income-statement.md` only |
| Load all UI skills for a button change | Load `component-library/SKILL.md` only |
| Load testing skills for a UI change | Skip testing unless the change affects calculations |
| Load research skills for a finance fix | Skip research entirely |
| Load source-code/SKILL.md (814 lines) routinely | Only load when you need a full file map |
| Read all 18 checker manual sections | Read only the section relevant to the task |

## Session Start Checklist

1. Read `claude.md` (auto-loaded via `replit.md`)
2. Identify the task type from the user's request
3. Look up the minimum skill set in the table above
4. Load only those skills
5. If unsure, start with the domain SKILL.md and drill into sub-skills as needed
6. After completing work, update only the skills you loaded (don't update unrelated skills)
