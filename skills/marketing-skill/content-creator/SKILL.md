# Content Creator → Redirected

> **This skill has been split into two specialist skills.** Use the one that matches your intent:

| You want to... | Use this instead |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Write** a blog post, article, or guide | [content-production](../content-production/) |
| **Plan** what content to create, topic clusters, calendar | [content-strategy](../content-strategy/) |
| **Analyze brand voice** | [content-production](../content-production/) (includes `brand_voice_analyzer.py`) |
| **Optimize SEO** for existing content | [content-production](../content-production/) (includes `seo_optimizer.py`) |
| **Create social media content** | [social-content](../social-content/) |

## Why the Change

The original `content-creator` tried to do everything: planning, writing, SEO, social, brand voice. That made it a jack of all trades. The specialist skills do each job better:

- **content-production** — Full pipeline: research → brief → draft → optimize → publish. Includes all Python tools from the original content-creator.
- **content-strategy** — Strategic planning: topic clusters, keyword research, content calendars, prioritization frameworks.

## Proactive Triggers

- **User asks "content creator"** → Route to content-production (most likely intent is writing).
- **User asks "content plan" or "what should I write"** → Route to content-strategy.

## Output Artifacts

| When you ask for... | Routed to... |
|---------------------|-------------|
| "Write a blog post" | content-production |
| "Content calendar" | content-strategy |
| "Brand voice analysis" | content-production (`brand_voice_analyzer.py`) |
| "SEO optimization" | content-production (`seo_optimizer.py`) |

## Communication

This is a redirect skill. Route the user to the correct specialist — don't attempt to handle the request here.
