# Hospitality Business Group — User Manual

## About This Manual

The User Manual provides end-user documentation for the Hospitality Business Group portal. It covers navigation, property management, financial analysis tools, exports, and AI assistant usage. The manual is accessible to all user roles via the Help page.

## File Structure

The in-app User Manual is split into lazy-loaded per-section files for performance and maintainability.

| `client/src/pages/user-manual/constants.ts` | Section metadata (IDs, titles, icons) |

## How to Edit

To edit a specific section, open the corresponding file in `sections/`. Each file is a self-contained React component that exports a default function with `SectionProps` interface (`expanded`, `onToggle`, `sectionRef`). The component wraps its content in a `SectionCard` (with `variant="light"`) and uses `ManualTable` and `Callout` for structured content.

To add a new section:
1. Create `SectionNN<Name>.tsx` in `sections/`
2. Add entry to `constants.ts`
3. Add lazy import to `UserManualContent.tsx`
