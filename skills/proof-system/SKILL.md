# Automated Financial Proof System

## Purpose
Eliminates human Excel verification. Code proves itself correct through 2371 automated tests across 5 structural golden scenarios, 65 hand-calculated golden reference tests, input-to-output pipeline verification, and magic number detection.

## Commands
```bash
npm test                          # Run all 2371 tests
npm run verify                    # Full 7-phase verification (UNQUALIFIED = pass)
npx vitest run tests/proof/       # Run only proof tests
npx vitest run tests/golden/      # Run 65 hand-calculated golden tests (~3s)
npx tsx tests/proof/verify-runner.ts  # 7-phase orchestrator directly
```

## 4-Phase Verification
1. **Scenarios** — 5 golden scenarios test every financial structure
2. **Hardcoded Detection** — Scans 8 finance files for magic numbers
3. **Reconciliation** — Generates artifact reports with math checks
4. **Artifact Summary** — Produces JSON + Markdown proof reports

## Audit Opinion Outputs
- **UNQUALIFIED** — All checks pass. No human verification needed.
- **QUALIFIED** — Minor issues detected. Review required.
- **ADVERSE** — Critical failures. Do not ship.

Only UNQUALIFIED is acceptable for production.

## 5 Structural Golden Scenarios (tests/proof/scenarios.test.ts)

| # | Scenario | What It Proves |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Cash purchase (no debt) | Pure equity model, no loan paths active |
| 2 | Financed purchase (LTV) | Debt sizing, amortization, DSCR, debt service |
| 3 | Cash → refinance year 3 | Refi mechanics, cash-out, loan swap, payoff |
| 4 | Portfolio aggregate | Multi-property aggregation, fee linkage |
| 5 | Consolidated + eliminations | Full intercompany elimination, consolidated statements |

## 65 Hand-Calculated Golden Tests (tests/golden/)

| File | Tests | Calculators Covered |
|------|-------|--------------------|
| `irr-edge-cases.test.ts` | 8 | IRR: single exit, monthly, near-zero, high, negative, alternating signs, 30yr, break-even |
| `dcf-npv.test.ts` | 8 | DCF/NPV: standard, zero rate, high rate, IRR cross-check, monthly, PV timeline |
| `equity-exit.test.ts` | 9 | Equity Multiple (2×, loss, break-even, multi-invest) + Exit Valuation (standard, debt-free, underwater, per-key) |
| `dscr-loan-sizing.test.ts` | 7 | DSCR: binding, LTV binding, IO, zero NOI, over-qualified, actual DSCR/implied LTV |
| `depreciation-breakeven.test.ts` | 10 | Depreciation (standard, improvements, 100% land, tax shield) + Break-Even (operating, cash flow, ancillary, sensitivity) |
| `stress-waterfall.test.ts` | 8 | Stress Test (recession, pandemic, risk score) + Waterfall (2-tier, shortfall, catch-up, zero) |
| `proforma-edge-cases.test.ts` | 15 | Full engine: all-cash, 90% LTV, zero revenue, negative tax, growth, ramp, refinance |

See `.claude/skills/testing/golden-scenarios.md` for full documentation of every scenario with hand-calculated derivations.

## 31 Enforced Guarantees
See `tests/proof/NO_EXCEL_GUARANTEE.md` for the full checklist mapping each guarantee to its enforcing test file.

## Key Test Files
```
tests/proof/
├── scenarios.test.ts           # 5 golden scenario tests
├── input-verification.test.ts  # 29 input-to-output pipeline tests
├── hardcoded-detection.test.ts # Magic number scanner (8 finance files)
├── reconciliation-report.test.ts # Artifact generator + debt reconciliation

```

## Input-to-Output Pipeline Coverage
- Revenue: rooms × ADR × occupancy × DAYS_PER_MONTH (recomputed from scratch)
- ADR: compounds at adrGrowthRate annually, flat within each year
- Occupancy: ramps from startOccupancy in steps, capped at maxOccupancy
- Variable costs: revenue × costRate (rooms, F&B, events, marketing, utilities, FF&E)
- Fixed costs: Year 1 base × costRate × (1 + escalationRate)^year
- Refi: NOI-cap valuation × LTV, proceeds = gross − closing costs

## Artifacts
`test-artifacts/` contains per-scenario JSON + Markdown reconciliation reports:
- Sources & Uses at acquisition
- NOI → FCF bridge
- Begin Cash → End Cash bridge
- Debt schedule reconciliation
- Intercompany elimination summary

## Key Invariants Tested
- Balance Sheet: A = L + E (ASC 210)
- OCF = NI + Depreciation (ASC 230-10-45)
- NI = NOI - Interest - Depreciation - Tax (ASC 220)
- CFF = -Principal + Refi Proceeds (ASC 230-10-45-15)
- Ending Cash = Beginning Cash + Net Cash Change (ASC 230-10-45-24)
- Fee Linkage: Σ(SPV fees) = OpCo revenue (intercompany)
- Consolidated eliminations net to zero
- FCFE Direct ≡ FCFE From-NI (two-method reconciliation)
- NPV = 0 at computed IRR (cross-validation)

## Hardcoded Value Detection
- Scans: `financialEngine.ts`, `refinance-calculator.ts`, `financial-identities.ts`, `schedule-reconcile.ts`, `consolidation.ts`
- Safe numbers: 0, 1, -1, 2, 12, 100
- Context exceptions: loop counters, array indices, Math functions, string literals

## Detailed Testing Skills
For per-statement and per-analysis test coverage, see:

| Skill | Path | Scope |
|-------|------|-------|
| Property Statements | `.claude/skills/testing/property-statements.md` | IS, CF, BS at property level |
| Consolidated Statements | `.claude/skills/testing/consolidated-statements.md` | Portfolio aggregation, eliminations |
| Management Company | `.claude/skills/testing/management-company.md` | OpCo pro forma, fee linkage, funding |
| Analysis: Returns | `.claude/skills/testing/analysis-returns.md` | IRR, NPV, MOIC, sensitivity |
| Analysis: DCF/FCF | `.claude/skills/testing/analysis-dcf-fcf.md` | FCF, FCFE reconciliation |
| Financing & Refinancing | `.claude/skills/testing/financing-refinance-funding.md` | Debt, refi, funding instruments |
| **Golden Scenarios** | **`.claude/skills/testing/golden-scenarios.md`** | **65 hand-calculated tests: IRR, DCF, DSCR, depreciation, break-even, stress, waterfall, exit, equity multiple, pro-forma edge cases** |

## Maintenance
1. Run `npm test` — all 2371 tests must pass
2. Run `npm run verify` — all 7 phases must pass
3. Run `npx vitest run tests/golden/` — 65 hand-calculated tests must pass (~3s)
4. Check `test-artifacts/*.md` for UNQUALIFIED opinions
5. New constants go in `shared/constants.ts` (never inline magic numbers)
6. New calculators require golden tests with hand-calculated reference values
7. Update testing skills when adding new test suites
